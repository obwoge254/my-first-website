<h3><span style="color:green;font-weight:normal">Background </span></h3>


<b>
   I did bachelors of science Information Technology in my undergraduate  but majored on the Networking bit . Fastfoward i went into 
   job market and started off as a ICT trainer until my contract lapsed. covid came up and i realized there was lot we could do remotely
   without actually  having a physical meet up and how technology was shifting to innovative ways of coping  and resilience. I realized 
   i had a good fundamental grip on technology so shifting from the networking lane to software engineering bit would leverage me further 
   to technolgy in terms of now sofware development.
